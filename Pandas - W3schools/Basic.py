What is Pandas?

Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.

It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data",
    and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

# If you want to change the original DataFrame, use the inplace = True argument:

df.dropna(inplace = True)

"""
Note: Now, the dropna(inplace = True) will NOT return a new DataFrame,
    but it will remove all rows containing NULL values from the original DataFrame.
"""






"""
Replace Empty Values

Another way of dealing with empty cells is to insert a new value instead.

This way you do not have to delete entire rows just because of some empty cells.

The fillna() method allows us to replace empty cells with a value:
"""

import pandas as pd

#Replace NULL values with the number "FILL_IN":
df.fillna("FILL_IN", inplace = True)











"""
Replace Only For Specified Columns

The example above replaces all empty cells in the whole Data Frame.

To only replace empty values for one column, specify the column name for the DataFrame:
"""

df["sex"] = df["sex"].fillna("FILL")


"""
df["sex"] = df["sex"].fillna("FILL")

This directly modifies the "sex" column in the original
 DataFrame, replacing any missing values (NaN) with the value "FILL".

It modifies the original DataFrame in-place and leaves the
 other columns in the DataFrame unaffected.
"""



"""
df = df["sex"].fillna("FILL")
This creates a new pandas Series with
 the "sex" column filled with the value
  "FILL" wherever there are missing values.

It doesnâ€™t modify the original DataFrame,
 and you would need to reassign it to df
  for the changes to persist in the DataFrame.

This approach will return only the filled
 column and will not affect the rest of the DataFrame.
"""


















"""
Replace Using Mean, Median, or Mode

A common way to replace empty cells, is to calculate the mean,
    median or mode value of the column.

Pandas uses the mean() median() and mode() methods
  to calculate the respective values for a specified column:
"""


x = df["bmi"].mean()

df["bmi"] = df["bmi"].fillna(x)




x = df["bmi"].median()

df["bmi"] = df["bmi"].fillna(x)












"""
Convert Into a Correct Format

In our Data Frame, we have two cells with the wrong format. 
  Check out row 22 and 26, the 'Date' 
  column should be a string that represents a date:
"""
#df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

#print(df.to_string())















"""
For small data sets you might be able to replace the wrong
  data one by one, but not for big data sets.

To replace wrong data for larger data sets you can create some rules,
  e.g. set some boundaries for legal values, and replace any
   values that are outside of the boundaries.




Replacing Values

One way to fix wrong values is to replace them with something else.

In our example, it is most likely a typo, and the value should be 
  "45" instead of "450", and we could just insert "45" in row 7:
"""


#Set "Duration" = 45 in row 7:

df.loc[7, 'age'] = 45














"""
Another way of handling wrong data is to
  remove the rows that contains wrong data.

This way you do not have to find out what to
  replace them with, and there is a good chance you do not need them to do your analyses.

"""

"""
Loop through all values in the "Duration" column.

If the value is higher than 120, set it to 120:
"""

for x in df.index:
  if df.loc[x, "age"] > 120:
    df.loc[x, "age"] = 120













"""

This way you do not have to find out what to
 replace them with, and there is
  a good chance you do not need them to do your analyses.
"""

#Delete rows where "Duration" is higher than 120:

for x in df.index:
  if df.loc[x, "age"] > 120:
    df.drop(x, inplace = True)










"""
Removing Duplicates

To remove duplicates, use the drop_duplicates() method.
"""

df.drop_duplicates(inplace = True)











#SELECT()
