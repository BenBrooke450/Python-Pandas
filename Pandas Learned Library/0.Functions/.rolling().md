 - rolling(window=3): This sets up a rolling window of size 3. You can adjust the window size based on your needs.

 - mean(): This calculates the mean of the values within each window. You can replace this with other aggregation functions like sum(), min(), max(), etc.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example DataFrame
data = {'Value': [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate a rolling mean with a window size of 3
df['Rolling_Mean'] = df['Value'].rolling(window=3).mean()

print(df)
```
